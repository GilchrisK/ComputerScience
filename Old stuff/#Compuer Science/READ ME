If you have admin rights you can create a new
if you dont have admin files then you cant create a new.


When creating a Login Demo, you have to make sure you use #show and #hide because there would be multiple tabs open.
This program only happens when its event driven.


Solution - You have to destroy the previous window before you open a new window.
            Ths is so that there arent multiple tabs on the screen which would make it confusing for the programmer.

            - When using a function call the parameter by a different name therefore you will not get confused.

            def create(W)

            def back(wx):      #Pass the window, destroy it then create a new one.
                wx.destroy()   #This will make sure there is only one comment/tab at a timne
                main()

When trying to calculate soemthing you have to take the values in the object
e.g. weight =50
You take the VALUE (50) in the object (Weight)
pass the object,extract the values

Using "get()" is useful because you pass the object, get the value and do the calculations
note -  calculations must be a vlue as you cannot multiply an object.

To use a messagebox you have to import it

Print in tkinter is not allowed in a procedure, it s only used for testing
Use message boxes
e.g. messagebox.showinfo
    message box.askquestions
